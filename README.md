# Final-Fantasy-Stock-Game
The goal of this project is to create a fantasy football -esq game, but instead using stocks. We look to have players be able to set up an account, join/create a league, choose stocks to add to their "team." They will be matched up against another player in their league, and get points based on percent change from the previous week at the end of trading Friday (compared to the previous EOD Friday). 

We connected our website and DB to a real time stock scraper using the YFinance Python Package. 

We will use an API design of some sort to connect the webpage to the DB. Our webpage is planned to be in PHP, HTML, CSS, and Python. We will be using SQL queries and testing the queries in MySQL locally. 

Our goal is to have a base version of the project set up and running, even if not being uupdated via a time-based task. This way, users can use all the elements of the site, with manual updating of rounds and stocks via running scripts.

Through Trello, we are tracking our progress of various task and requirements.
