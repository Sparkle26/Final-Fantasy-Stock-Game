# Final-Fantasy-Stock-Game
The goal of this project is to create a fantasy football -esq game, but instead using stocks. We look to have players be able to set up an account, join/create a league, choose (for now) about 3 stocks to add to their "team." They will be matched up against another player in their league, and get points based on percent change from the previous week at the end of trading Friday (compared to the previous EOD Friday). 

We are going to (somehow) connect the site to a finance website (Yahoo Finance?) to get the prices once a week, as to compare. 

We will use an API design of some sort to connect the webpage to the DB. Our webpage is planned to be in PHP and JSON, with elements of HTML. We will be using SQL queries and testing the queries in MySQL locally. 

Our goal is to have the page mostly working and set up; while of course we aim to have a fully operational and functional, if this is not feasable, we want the pages to work, even if the functionality is not completly there.

Through Trello, we are tracking our progress of various task and requirements.
