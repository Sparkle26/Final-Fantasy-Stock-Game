# Final-Fantasy-Stock-Game
The goal of this project is to create a fantasy football -esq game, but instead using stocks. We look to have players be able to set up an account, join/create a league, choose (for now) about 3 stocks to add to their "team." They will be matched up against another player in their league, and get points based on percent change from the previous week at the end of trading Friday (compared to the previous EOD Friday). 

We are going to (somehow) connect the site to a finance website (Yahoo Finance?) to get the prices once a week, as to compare.
